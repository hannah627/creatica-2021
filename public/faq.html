        Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a person's thoughts, emotions,
        relationships, and daily functioning. They fall along a spectrum of severity and
        interference in daily life, and mean nothing about a person's character, intelligence, or
        willpower. They can be treated with a combination of social support and medication, and
        as many as 70-90% of people who receive treatment will see decreased symptoms and improved
        quality of life.

      <p class="hidden">
        Mental health issues can be caused by psychological, biological, or social issues (or some
        combination of the three). Often, stress can exacerbate mental health issues and increase
        their interference in daily life. Mental health conditions (like schizophrenia, chronic
        depression, etc.) are also exacerbated by stress, but are usually genetic and generally
        mainfest in adolescence. Regardless of if you're dealing with a mental illness or a
        mental health issue, there are resources available that can help.

        If your beliefs , thoughts , feelings or behaviours have a significant impact on your
        ability to function in what might be considered a normal or ordinary way, it is
        important to seek help.

        It is often more realistic and helpful to find out what helps with the issues you face.
        Talking, counselling, medication, friendships, exercise, good sleep and nutrition, and
        meaningful occupation can all help.
